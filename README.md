MyHaskellModule
===============

So, I started learning Haskell full time last Saturday (was on/off for a while). I thought why not create a module of my own. 
It contains functions that range from very basic to moderately complex. They aren't for any specific purpose except acting as a tool to learn Haskell.

Rationale: I never liked learning a programming language at a fast pace. Thus, I love taking my time and being under no pressure to deliver in the said language helps alot. Haskell seems interesting; I would like to keep it that way by not rushing into it. I am studying each topic in as much detail as I can muster. if you are a learned Haskeller, you would notice most of my functions are derived or even similar to the ones shown as examples on learnyouahaskell.com. Soon, I shall be writing more than moderately complex functions. Until then bear with me.

For any comments on my deadlines, I would like to divert you to:
